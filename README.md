# 🔋 Renewable Energy Usage Predictor

An AI-powered app that forecasts future renewable energy usage across sectors and energy sources using machine learning. Designed to support data-driven decision-making for energy planning, sustainability tracking, and policy development.

## 🌍 Purpose

This application enables:
- Accurate prediction of **total renewable energy usage** over time.
- Forecasting of **sector-specific** renewable consumption trends.
- Visual analysis of energy source combinations most likely to dominate in future years.

## 📊 Key Features

- ✅ Predicts future usage using historical energy data.
- 📈 Visualizes energy trends by year, sector, and source.
- 🧠 Machine Learning powered with scalable architecture.
- 📌 Streamlit-based interactive interface with dropdown filtering.
- 🔮 Future-ready: Swappable model interface for continuous learning.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend/UI**: Streamlit
- **Modeling**: Scikit-learn (Linear Regression, RandomForest)
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Deployment**: Streamlit Community Cloud (Free)

## 🌐 Deployment (Streamlit Cloud)

1. Push code to a **public GitHub repo**.
2. Go to [Streamlit Cloud](https://share.streamlit.io).
3. Connect your GitHub repo and select `energy_app.py` as the main file.
4. Add the `requirements.txt` file.
5. Click "Deploy". You’ll get a shareable URL.

## 📌 Use Cases

* 🔋 **Government & Energy Agencies**: Forecast renewable adoption by sector.
* 💼 **Businesses & Investors**: Spot opportunities in the renewable energy market.
* 📚 **Researchers & Students**: Understand energy usage dynamics over time.

## 📈 Future Improvements

* Add real-time data integration (via APIs).
* Expand models to include regional predictions.
* Incorporate ensemble learning for improved accuracy.
* Export predictions to Excel/CSV reports.

---

## 🤖 Model Training Notes

* Sector labels encoded using `LabelEncoder`.
* Historical datetime features are parsed into `Year`, `Month`, and optionally `Quarter`.
* Separate models trained for total usage and sector-specific forecasts.
* Replace synthetic predictions (`np.random.uniform`) with trained model output using:

```python
prediction = trained_model.predict(input_features)
```
